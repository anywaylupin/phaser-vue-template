# Phaser + Vue Template

This template provides a robust starting point for game development by integrating Phaser 3, Vue 3, TypeScript, and Phaser Editor 2D v3. It is designed to offer well-typed game objects and scenes, allowing developers to create engaging and interactive games with ease.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:

- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) - Enable this extension and disable Vetur for Vue 3 support.
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) - Provides additional TypeScript tooling for Vue.

## Customize Configuration

For specific project configuration details, refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

To get started, install the dependencies using `pnpm`.

```sh
pnpm install
```

To update the dependencies to their latest versions:

```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

To start the development server with hot-reload support:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

When you're ready to build your game for production:

```sh
